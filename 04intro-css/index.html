            <h1>Origin of the Guitar</h1>
            <p>The origins of the guitar are not known. Before the development of the electric guitar and the use of synthetic materials, a guitar was defined as being an instrument having "a long, fretted neck, flat wooden soundboard, ribs, and a flat back, most often with incurved sides." The term is used to refer to a number of chordophones that were developed and used across Europe, beginning in the <strong>12th century</strong> and, later, in the Americas. A 3,300-year-old stone carving of a Hittite bard playing a stringed instrument is the oldest iconographic representation of a chordophone and clay plaques from Babylonia show people playing a lute-like instrument which is similar to the guitar.</p>
            <p>However, we do know that in 1850, the form and structure of the modern acoustic guitar were developed by different Spanish makers such as Manuel de Soto y Solares and, perhaps the most important of all guitar makers, Antonio Torres Jurado, who increased the size of the guitar body, altered its proportions, and invented the breakthrough fan-braced pattern. Bracing, the internal pattern of wood reinforcements used to secure the guitar's top and back and prevent the instrument from collapsing under tension, is an important factor in how the guitar sounds. Torres' design greatly improved the volume, tone, and projection of the instrument, and it has remained essentially unchanged since.</p>

            <p>The oldest surviving guitar in the world was made by <em>Belchior Diaz</em>, a Portugese luthier, around 1590 and is currently at the Musical Instrument Musemum in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>

            <h2>Why Care?</h2>
            <p>The guitar is a flexible instrument, whose tone and timbre are suitable for most styles of music. The guitar plays a central role in popular music, Rock, Latin, funk, jazz, and more. It has also made its way into most other styles of music as a cameo instrument. In fact, maost of the songs you normally listen to probably have a guitar playing at some point.</p>
